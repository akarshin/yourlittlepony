# Your Little Pony

Your Little Pony is a collection of My Little Pony screens from Season 1 and Season 2. Plus some scripts, which help you post those screens wherever you want.

## Why?

Why not? Ponies are cool! Pinkie Pie is the most awesome of all! So tell me why not?

If you need a justification, though. I know that the developers in my team work really really hard. Unfortunately, the immense brain activity always results in huge amounts of stress. Ponies here are a "comic relief", a coping mechanism to relieve tension and reduce the amount of stress everyone is experiencing.

I have a Slack app, which posts to #pony_of_the_day channel three times a day, saying "Good morning" at 9am, asking if the channel members had already had a lunch around noon and wishing the perfect rest of the day at 5pm. I hope this brings a smile to the members of #pony_of_the_day and they feel a little bit better every time they see a pony.

## Installation and Usage

Installation is siple. Do `git clone` and you're ready to go.

Right now there is only one script, which posts to Slack.

## Slack

You absolutely must create and configure a Slack App before you can post images to Slack. A good starting point is [Your Slack Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps), the rest is in their documentation, please refer to that.

Then you must copy `slack.config.dist` to `slack.config` and manually set up all the values.

The `slack` script has only one optional parrameter, which is the image comment. If you do not provide one, then the one in `CONFIG[message]` is used as fall back.

```
[akarshin@localhost yourlittlepony]$ slack                                  ### This will send the defaul message, which is "Pony Of The Day!"
[akarshin@localhost yourlittlepony]$ slack "Good morning!"                  ### This will send "Good morning!"
```

After you're done with installation, you can set up cron, which would call `slack` script, for a bit of automation. Otherwise you'd have to run the script manually.

#### How does it look on Slack?
